# URL Shortner App

A web application to shorten urls and generate qr-codes. The application is not currently connected to a backend so no sign-up is possible.

## Installation

It comprises PHP, CSS and JavaScript files so a server is required to run the PHP files.

I, however, require users of the repository code to remove any personal information found in the code before using it. Thank you!
